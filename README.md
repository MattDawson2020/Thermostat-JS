# Maker's Week 6: Weekly challenge
This challenge was the return to weekly pair programmed challenges following Airbnb group project week.
This time we changed languages from Ruby to Javscript.
The learning objectives for this week were:

* Test drive a simple front end web app with JavsScript
* Follow an effective process for learning a new language
* DOM manipulation
* Creating dynamic pages that do not rely on a page refresh



**Weekend Challange**
I decided to skip this weeks' weekend challenge as it was a Ruby coding challenge that was equivalent to a level 3-4 CodeWars Kata.
The idea was that you would then later translate this into JavaScript, but I decided it was a better use of my time to consolidate my previous weeks learning.
This involved:

* Re-reading my previous projects to ensure that I could explain the code and decisions made, and to identify improvements
* Doing the weeks' practicals in both ES5 and ES6 to ensure I understood the difference in syntax
* Looking at previous projects and identifying areas where JavaScript could provide additional functionality or improvements
